Patches are the central object in Patchwork structure. A patch
contains both a diff and some metadata, such as the name, the
description, the author, the version of the patch etc. Patchwork
stores not only the patch itself but also various metadata
associated with the email that the patch was parsed from, such as
the message headers or the date the message itself was received.

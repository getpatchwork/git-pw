.SH NAME
git-pw\-bundle \- Interact with bundles.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B git-pw bundle
[OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Interact with bundles.
.PP
Bundles are custom, user-defined groups of patches. Bundles can be
used to keep patch lists, preserving order, for future inclusion in
a tree. There's no restriction of number of patches and they don't
even need to be in the same project. A single patch also can be
part of multiple bundles at the same time.  An example of Bundle
usage would be keeping track of the Patches that are ready for
merge to the tree.

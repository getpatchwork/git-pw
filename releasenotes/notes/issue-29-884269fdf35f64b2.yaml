    Many commands now take a ``--format``/``-f`` parameter, which can be used
    to control the output format. Three formats are currently supported:

    - ``table`` (default)
    - ``simple`` (a version of table with less markup)
    - ``csv`` (comma-separated output)
  - |
    All list comands now take a ``--column``/``-c`` parameter, which can be
    used to control what columns are output. This can be specified multiples
    times. All columns are output by default.
